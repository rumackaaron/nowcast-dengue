===============

Provides derivative-free optimization over a bounded, one-dimensional interval.

The function to optimize doesn't have to be convex, but it is assumed that it
has a single maximum and is monotonically decreasing away from that maximum in
both directions.

More general optimization problems can be solved using, for example, the
Nelder-Mead algorithm.

def maximize(low, high, objective, stop):
  """
  Find the scalar argument which maximizes the objective function. The search
  space is bounded to the closed interval [low, high].

  input:
    low: the lower bound of the search interval
    high: the upper bound of the search interval
    objective: an objective function, which takes and returns a scalar
    stop: a function which returns whether the search should be stopped, given
        the following parameters:
      - number of times the objective function has been called
      - width of the current search interval
      - the maximum value of the objective function so far

  output:
    a tuple consisting of:
      - the argument which maximizes the objective function
      - the maximum value of the objective function

  # The algorithm below is inspired by the Nelder-Mead and bisection methods.

  # This method tracks a set of four points and their associated values, as
  # returned by the objective function. One of the values must be less than or
  # equal to the remaining values. Its point -- the argmin -- is iteratively
  # updated. If the argmax is not on the boundary, then the argmin is updated
  # to bisect the two argmax points. Otherwise, the two argmin points are
  # updated to trisect the two argmax points. Iteration continues until the
  # stop function returns truth.
